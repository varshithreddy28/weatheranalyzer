# Weather Analyzer

The Weather Analyzer gives the Weather data of a place
In this first we need to enter the city name




Then it will redirect to the weather data page
In which first it will show the Present weather at that particular place.



When we scroll down we can get the FOUR days forecast of the place


Below it we can get the forecast of Six near by Cities





The website can be found at:
